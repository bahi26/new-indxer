src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width=200> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.<p>History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.<p>The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.<p>This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. <p>Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.<p><b>The Archive Team Panic Downloads</b> are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures. <p>	</div>	      </div>      <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;width:49%;">			<span class="c-logo" style="background-image:url(https://archive.org/services/img/archiveteam_newssites)"></span>		<div>Collection: <a style="color:#33f;" href="https://archive.org/details/archiveteam_newssites" target="_new"><span class="wm-title">Archive Team: The News Roundup</span></a></div>		<div style="max-height:75px;overflow:hidden;position:relative;">	  <div style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:75px;background:linear-gradient(to bottom,rgba(255,255,255,0) 0%,rgba(255,255,255,0) 90%,rgba(255,255,255,255) 100%);"></div>	  Archive Team now searches many, many news sites, including extensive worldwide and obscure sources, to capture unique news stories for history.	</div>	      </div>    </div>    <div style="background-color:#666;color:#fff;font-weight:bold;text-align:center" title="Timestamps for the elements of this page">TIMESTAMPS</div>    <div>      <div id="wm-capresources" style="margin:0 5px 5px 5px;max-height:250px;overflow-y:scroll !important"></div>      <div id="wm-capresources-loading" style="text-align:left;margin:0 20px 5px 5px;display:none"><img src="/static/images/loading.gif" alt="loading" /></div>    </div>  </div></div></div></div><script type="text/javascript">__wm.bt(575,27,25,2,"web","http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/science/neanderthals-interbred-with-humans-denisovans.html","2016-03-17",1996);</script><!-- END WAYBACK TOOLBAR INSERT -->        <style>    .lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions {        display: block !important;        height: 50px;    }    .lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions .message-bed {        background-color: #f8e9d2;        border-bottom: 1px solid #ccc;    }    .lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions .message-container {        padding: 11px 18px 11px 30px;    }    .lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions .action-link {        font-family: "nyt-franklin", arial, helvetica, sans-serif;        font-size: 10px;        font-weight: bold;        color: #a81817;        text-transform: uppercase;    }    .lt-ie10 .messenger.suggestions .alert-icon {        background: url('https://web.archive.org/web/20160317184115im_/https://static01.nyt.com/images/icons/icon-alert-12x12-a81817.png') no-repeat;        width: 12px;        height: 12px;        display: inline-block;        margin-top: -2px;        float: none;    }    .lt-ie10 .masthead,    .lt-ie10 .navigation,    .lt-ie10 .comments-panel {        margin-top: 50px !important;    }    .lt-ie10 .ribbon {        margin-top: 97px !important;    }</style><div id="suggestions" class="suggestions messenger nocontent robots-nocontent" style="display:none;">    <div class="message-bed">        <div class="message-container last-message-container">            <div class="message">                <span class="message-content">                    <i class="icon alert-icon"></i><span class="message-title">NYTimes.com no longer supports Internet Explorer 9 or earlier.

humans interbred with Neanderthals and another extinct line of humans known as the Denisovans at least four times in the course of prehistory, according to an analysis of global genomes published on Thursday in the journal Science.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="113" data-total-count="368">The interbreeding may have given modern humans genes that bolstered immunity

interbreeding surfaced in 2010, when scientists discovered that some modern humans — mostly Europeans — carry DNA that <a

of Africa more than 50,000 years ago.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="191" data-total-count="1556">But the Neanderthals were not the only extinct humans that our own ancestors found. A finger bone discovered in a Siberian cave, called Denisova, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317184115/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/23/science/23ancestor.html">yielded DNA from yet another group of humans.</a></p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="249" data-total-count="1805">Research later indicated that all three groups — modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans — shared a common ancestor who lived roughly 600,000 years ago.
